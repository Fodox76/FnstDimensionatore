# FnstDimensionatore
An utility to measure screen by pixels. It's a resizable window with the current size in the middle. You can use arrow keys to move it or shift + arrow keys to resize it. Right click on it for other options: set opacity, set colors, set border size.
So simple as so useful, i.e. for web design :-)
